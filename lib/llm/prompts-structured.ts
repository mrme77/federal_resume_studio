================================================================================
JOB TAILORING REQUIREMENTS (CRITICAL)
================================================================================

You are optimizing this resume for a SPECIFIC JOB POSITION. Follow these tailoring rules:

**STEP 1: ANALYZE THE TARGET JOB**
- Carefully read and analyze the job description below
- Identify key duties, responsibilities, and requirements
- Note important keywords, technical terms, and action verbs used
- Identify required skills, qualifications, and experience areas

**STEP 2: OPTIMIZE WORK EXPERIENCE FOR JOB ALIGNMENT**
When extracting work experience responsibilities:
1. **Rephrase accomplishments** to mirror the language and terminology used in the job description
2. **Prioritize relevant experiences** - emphasize positions and duties that align with the target job
3. **Expand matching experiences** - provide more detail (4-5 bullets) for highly relevant positions
4. **Use job-specific keywords** - incorporate key terms from the job description naturally
5. **Highlight transferable skills** - emphasize skills and experiences that match job requirements

**STEP 3: ENHANCE BULLET POINTS**
For each responsibility bullet:
- If it relates to a job duty, use similar action verbs and terminology from the job description
- Emphasize quantifiable achievements that demonstrate capabilities needed for the target job
- Draw connections between past accomplishments and future job requirements
- Maintain OPM best practices (metrics, impact, results)

**STEP 4: OPTIMIZE SKILLS & QUALIFICATIONS**
- Extract and emphasize skills that match the job requirements
- Include relevant technical skills, certifications, or training mentioned in the job description
- Ensure citizenship, clearance, and eligibility information is accurate

**CRITICAL CONSTRAINTS:**
✓ MUST maintain OPM federal resume compliance
✓ MUST stay within 2-page target (prioritize recent + relevant content)
✓ MUST preserve factual accuracy - only rephrase, don't fabricate
✓ MUST keep required federal elements (dates, hours, grades, etc.)
✓ Content should be optimized, not falsified

**TARGET JOB DESCRIPTION:**
---
${jobDescription}
---

Now extract and optimize the resume content with this job position in mind.

================================================================================
EXTRACTION RULES
================================================================================

**1. CONTACT INFORMATION (REQUIRED)**
- Extract full name, phone, email, location if available
- Phone format: XXX-XXX-XXXX (normalize if needed)
- **IMPORTANT:** If information is NOT found in the resume, use these placeholders:
  * Phone not found: "[PHONE]"
  * Email not found: "[EMAIL]"
  * Location not found: "[LOCATION]"
- Do NOT omit fields - always include them with placeholders if data is missing

**2. CITIZENSHIP & ELIGIBILITY (REQUIRED)**
- Extract U.S. Citizenship status
- Include veterans preference if mentioned
- Include security clearance if mentioned
- **If information not found:**
  * Citizenship not stated: "U.S. Citizenship: [NOT SPECIFIED]"
  * Veterans preference not mentioned: "Veterans Preference: None" or omit field
  * Security clearance not mentioned: omit field entirely

**3. WORK EXPERIENCE (REQUIRED)**
- List in reverse chronological order (most recent first)
- **CRITICAL 5-YEAR RULE:** Include ALL positions that were **active at ANY point during the last 5 years**
  * **CURRENT DATE: ${currentDateStr}**
  * **5-YEAR CUTOFF DATE: ${fiveYearsAgoStr}**
  * **5-YEAR WINDOW: ${fiveYearsAgoStr} to ${currentDateStr}**
  * A position qualifies if its employment period overlaps with this window AT ALL
  * Example: If a job ran from ${fiveYearsAgo.getFullYear() - 1} to ${fiveYearsAgo.getFullYear() + 1}, INCLUDE IT because it was active during ${fiveYearsAgo.getFullYear()}-${fiveYearsAgo.getFullYear() + 1}
- For EACH position extract:
  * **Job title** - Extract ONLY the position name into the "title" field
    - Include level if mentioned (Senior, Lead, Manager, etc.) but NO grade/series info
    - **CRITICAL:** DO NOT include GS-##, series numbers, or grade levels in the title
    - Examples of correct title extraction:
      * Source: "Data Scientist, GS-13, 1560" → Extract: "Data Scientist"
      * Source: "Senior Program Manager (GS-14)" → Extract: "Senior Program Manager"
      * Source: "IT Specialist, GS-2210-12" → Extract: "IT Specialist"
  * **Grade and series** - Extract separately into the "grade" field if federal position
    - Format: "GS-[Series]-[Grade]" like "GS-1560-13" or "GS-2210-14"
    - **CRITICAL:** Use format "GS-XXXX-XX" where XXXX is the series and XX is the grade
    - **DO NOT** duplicate the grade level (wrong: "GS-13, 1560, GS-13" - correct: "GS-1560-13")
    - Example: For a GS-13 Data Scientist in series 1560, use "GS-1560-13"
  * Hours per week - use "40 hrs/week" as default if not stated
  * Organization/employer name
  * Location (City, State) - use "[LOCATION]" if not found
  * Start and end dates in MM/YYYY format - use "[START DATE]" or "[END DATE]" if missing
  * 3-5 responsibility bullets (optimize for impact and metrics)
- **Use placeholders for missing data** - don't omit fields entirely

**WORK EXPERIENCE OPTIMIZATION RULES:**
- Focus on RECENT and RELEVANT experience (prioritize positions active in last 5 years)
- Include ALL positions that overlap with the 5-year window (even if they started earlier)
- More recent roles = more detail (4-5 bullets with strong metrics)
- Older roles that overlap the window = less detail (2-3 bullets)
- Remove positions ONLY if they ended more than 5 years ago AND are not directly relevant
- Each bullet should:
  * Use active voice and strong action verbs
  * Include quantifiable metrics when possible (numbers, percentages, dollar amounts)
  * Show impact and results, not just duties
  * Demonstrate accomplishments and contributions

**VOLUNTEER WORK & INTERNSHIPS:**
- Format the same as paid employment
- Include hours per week
- These count as qualifying experience

**4. EDUCATION (REQUIRED if applicable)**
- List all degrees in reverse chronological order
- Extract: degree type, institution, location, graduation date
- Include GPA only if mentioned and recent graduate

**5. CERTIFICATIONS & TRAINING (Optional)**
- Extract all professional certifications
- Include issuer, date obtained, expiration if available
- List relevant training courses separately

**6. SKILLS (Optional - only if relevant)**
- Group into: technical, languages, other
- Only include skills that strengthen candidacy
- For languages, include proficiency level

================================================================================
CONTENT OPTIMIZATION GUIDELINES (OPM BEST PRACTICES)
================================================================================

**PLAIN LANGUAGE:**
- Use concise, clear language
- Define acronyms on first use (e.g., "Customer Relationship Management (CRM)")
- Avoid jargon unless industry-standard

**QUANTIFIABLE DATA:**
- Include metrics: "Managed team of 12 employees"
- Show percentages: "Increased efficiency by 30%"
- Include dollar amounts: "Reduced costs by $50,000 annually"
- Show volume: "Processed 500+ applications weekly"

**IMPACT-FOCUSED:**
- Emphasize what was accomplished, not just what was done
- Show how and why it mattered
- Include measurable results

**DATA PRESERVATION (DO NOT REMOVE):**
✓ Grade levels (GS-XX)
✓ Series numbers (2210, 0343, etc.)
✓ Employment dates
✓ Hours per week
✓ Security clearance information
✓ Phone and email addresses
✓ Certification numbers and dates
✓ Quantifiable metrics

**DATA REMOVAL (MUST REMOVE):**
✗ Salary information
✗ Website URLs (LinkedIn, GitHub, personal sites, portfolios)
✗ Social media profiles
✗ Any hyperlinks (http://, https://, www.)
✗ Outdated/non-relevant experience (to meet 2-page goal)

================================================================================
FINAL OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS
================================================================================

1. Return ONLY the JSON object - no additional text
2. Ensure valid JSON syntax (proper quotes, commas, brackets)
3. All string values must use double quotes
4. Do not include comments in the JSON
5. Ensure all required fields are present
6. Optional fields can be omitted or set to empty arrays/null
